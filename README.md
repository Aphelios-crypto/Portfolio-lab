# Portfolio Lab

## Purpose
This is a simple, accessible, and responsive portfolio page built with **HTML + CSS only**.  
It includes an **About Me** section and a **Projects** section.

## How to Open

2. Open `index.html` in your browser.

## Accessibility Notes
- Skip link added for keyboard users.
- Proper heading hierarchy (`h1` → `h2` → `h3`).
- Meaningful `alt` text for the image.
- High color contrast (WCAG AA).
- Focus styles are visible (no `outline: none`).
